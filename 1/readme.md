# Chapter 1

## Warning
  
  The sirens pierced through the night as if they were blades stabbing through fabric. Colt awoke in a cold sweat to find water dripping down his t-shirt. Lights flashed through his curtains, speed by towards a destination unknown. Shoving the dark cloth aside, he saw a precession of emergency and military vehicles moving through his street. Their destination could only be the coastline. A shock rippled across his body as he realized that something serious was going on. Colt rushed to his closest and threw on his jacket and hastily dressed himself. Without time to waste he ripped everything off the bookshelf in his room, revealing a safe built into the back wall. 
  
  Inside were several manilla folders and a Glock 43X. The slim pistol held only 10 bullets, but it wasn't for a firefight. Modified with glow sights, this weapon was ideal for a prepper who needed to bug out at night in a rush and couldn't carry standard equipment. Colt slid it into a concealed carry pouch in his jeans and stuffed the folders into a metal brief case, turning a mechnical dial to lock it in place.
  
  Outside the noise was defeaning. It wasn't just the vehicle sirens going off, but industrial tornado sirens were going at twice the normal decibel level. A torrent of sound was rolling across the suburbs of Norfolk, Virginia.
